(This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Payment Technology, are technology that allows transactions to be made via online or mobile app. Paypal has been the early innovator in the space, and now there has been many fintech companies, including Sea Ltd are currently adapting this technology, with more value-added benefits emerge alongside.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? Payments/Billing

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? 
Before coronavirus pandemic, the emerging trends in GSEA digital economy can be derived from the main regional metropolises, including Greater Bangkok, Kualla Lumpur, Singapore, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Metro Manila, and Jabodetabek. As these central hubs expanding, so does the availability of internet connectivity to the population outside of these areas: almost 80% of GSEA population living in rural areas had limited access to the internet a decade ago, but now the region has over 360 million internet users, make them the most engaged mobile internet users in the world. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the trend is accelerating, as people are changing their grocering habits to "avoid potential exposure to the coronavirus". 

* What are the other major companies in this domain? Leading players in key ASEAN countries: Alipay, Wechat Pay, GrabPay.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? Seamoney has become a main means of payment for young adults in the region, particularly in Thailand where Seamoney (called as Airpay in Thailand) was first launched: there are now 1.4 million registered users, ages span across 17-24 years old who like spending money on entertainment and lifestyle products via digital platforms like Seamoney rather than traditional banking services. Evenmore, 70% of Seamoney app users reported to have no credit card or a debit card for e-payments.  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?  Gross transaction value, or GTV, is a measure used by e-commerce companies with a marketplace where multiple sellers transact. GTV is equal to the number of items sold multiplied by the price collected. In this case, the business model is based on commission whereas the e-commerce company’s income is equal to a certain percentage of the GTV (GTV less costs paid to channel). In this case, the revenue is equal to income from commissions. For SEA ltd, because their Seamoney is tightly  tightly integrated in Garena and Shopee’s infrastructure, it can be expected that the GTV processed by the system will grow organically in the medium term. Sea’s revenue mix in Q3 2019 shows that 33.6% of its revenue comes from e-commerce and 59.1% comes from gaming with the balance
attributed to other ancillary services. Coupled with the expected growth in gaming and e-commerce in the region, we can project that the payments processed by its platforms would rise by 16.7%, outpacing the
10.6% growth that digital payments are expected to grow at until 2025.


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? in comparison to their biggest competitor, Alipay, SEA Ltd still have a long way to go. Along the domestic growth potential of China's total transaction value (estimated at $1.9 trillion USD in 2020) in digital payment, Alipay has managed to capture 54.5% in China's market share. Their expansion into GSEA region could become the greatest threat to SEA ltd in the long term. Besides, Grabpay is another strong competitor that could match with Seamoney in the region. As Grab turns from a ride-hailing app into a super app, its e-wallet
becomes a viable method to pay for rides and other services. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!): Wealth Management, Robo-advising.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? GSEA is in the midst of change, with banks eager to roll out new wealth management services to the growing mass affluent population. Changing demographics and income growth are increasing the number of people entering the middle class, with rapid urbanization set to double the region’s middle class to 163 million households between 2017 and 2030, and with per-capita GDP to rise almost 3-fold to more than US$9,000 in the same period. Regulatory developments have also been encouraging with these technologies, with regulators recognizing the empowering effect technology is having for the growing mass affluent population. Easy-to-use, accessible and safe, regulators are beginning to see that robo-advisory technology in wealth management and personalised finance not only has the power to put rising wealth to work but it also offers tremendous educational value for this increasingly prosperous part of the world.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Robo-advisors use automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with little to no human supervision. A typical robo-advisor collects information from clients about their financial situation and future goals through an online survey and then uses the data to offer advice and automatically invest client assets. most robo-advisors will utilize modern portfolio theory (or some variant) in order to build passive, indexed portfolios for the users. Once established, robo-advisors continue to monitor those portfolios to ensure that the optimal asset class weightings are maintained even after markets move. Robo-advisors achieve this by using rebalancing bands.In the past, this type of rebalancing has been frowned upon because it can be time consuming and generate transaction fees. However, with robo-advisors this is both automatic and virtually no-cost.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? As Seamoney leveraging on Shopee’s organic user base, they have a large pool of high-quality data, strong on-platform demand and operational efficiency of their customers, which they could be able to pilot consumer credit programs and to build up the credit assessment capabilities. With their expansion onto the banking industry by acquiring Singapore digital bank license, the technologies will definitely valuable addtionals for SEA Ltd to become a global fintech giant.
